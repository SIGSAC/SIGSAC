# Situation

## Terrain
Having received the mission to complete the Winter Challenge Writeup the second day of  Re-organization week, PillowFood will be unable to complete all nine tasks assigned.
## Friendly
I receive little comfort to hear that my peers have also had a difficult time executing the mission.

## Enemy
The enemy PillowFood confronts in the Winter Challnege is a threefold challenge:


Time | Himself | My Peers
--- | --- | ---
18 Hours Remaining | Learning as much as he can | Setting up more Machines than my peers

# Mission
NLT 160008JAN2020, team member PillowFood will build and document an enterprise network of virtual machines on the issued C3T laptops IOT secure one of the 12 positions for the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition on 25JAN2020.

# Execution
## Explanation
Given little remaining time and given my peers have advanced farther than I, **the strategy that optimizes my chance of making the team is to focus my efforts on creating an effective writeup**. PillowFood recognizes that in competition technical ability is valued above all skills, but without properly communicating the technical process any hack or exploit is not given the maximum point value it can earn.

## Key Tasks
1. PillowFood will setup one VM using Virtual Box: *Ubuntu 18.04*
2. PillowFood will install VirtualBox Guest Addition for *Ubuntu 18.04*
3. PIllowFood will write an effective writeup

## Endstate
The endstate is to have an effective writeup. An effective writeup consists of the following qualities:

1. Communicates tersely and thouroughly all steps taken
2. Visually Appealing to the event grader
