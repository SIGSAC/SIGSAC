# Markdown in a nutshell
Ironically, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language, think of HTML's lightweight brother.
* Like HTML, there are certain rules/conventions to enable you to type up a well formatted document.
* After uploading a Markdown document, Github processes the code and presents it **pleasantly** to viewers
* Github Writeups are universally done in Markdown

# Fundamentals

### The best way to learn is by looking at other people's writeups and recreating them. Learn about what you (don't) like about other styles and then create your own.
